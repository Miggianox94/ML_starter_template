# Machine Learning templates
In this repo you will find some jupyter notebook to use as starting point for your ML projects.
At the moment you can find only the classification template but I plan to add other templates for other tasks.

In the **example** folder you can find a working version of this template used for one of my experiments.

# Classification - structure

At the top of notebook you can find this index:
1.  Import of common libraries
2.  Data ingestion & cleaning
3.  Data Analysis and visualization
4.  Feature Selection
5.  ML model selection
6.  ML model tuning
7.  Results visualizations
8.  Model export
9.  Python and html generation

These are the steps followed in the notebook.
In some cells you eventually have to insert your specific code and data manipulation steps but the notebook tries to be as generic as possible.
> **Parameters:** One of the first cell is dedicated to your input so you need to complete this part at least.
